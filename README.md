###Scope
The goal was to create an app that allows the user to take care of Pusheen. 
The user could give him a gentle pat, but he will get mad if its too fast.
Eatting apples also make Pusheen happy. The user can get an apple by tapping and dragging it from the basket.
If the apple doesn't reach Pusheen it will fall off the screen. 
Pusheen also has a restfullness timer that goes down if he is not sleeping. Sleep recharges the meter.

Out of scope features (may be added on future releases) include:
* Let you pat Pusheen faster without him getting angry if his restfulness meter is high.
* If his restfulness metter hits 0 he will get angry and won't eat for 20 seconds
* Fix restfulness meter flashing
